# Notes

Please add here any notes, assumptions and design decisions that might help up understand your though process.

1 - There's a gap in the commits timeline as I had to stop for a bit
2 - I am aware the design is not taking into account the specific product to apply discount
3 - I started a second case which is not complete
4 - I focused the time more aroung the flexibility of the design rather than specific scenarios
